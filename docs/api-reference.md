# 📡 API Reference & Swagger

## Centralized Swagger UI

You can access the aggregated API documentation through the API Gateway:

👉 **[http://localhost:8080/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8080/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html)**

(Note: You might need to select the specific service definition from the dropdown if aggregation is not fully automatic).

## Direct Service Swagger UIs

If you need to access a specific service's documentation directly:
